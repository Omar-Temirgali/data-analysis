Inspiration
I have been a huge fan of Korean Drama and K pop since high-school. It is fun to integrate what I love with my interest toward data science. Some of the interesting questions (possibly tasks) here would be:

What is/are the popular Genres and Theme (Tags column) and does it leads to higher rating?
Does the day at which is the drama is aired affects its rating?
Create a recommendation system for the Drama (and check with the recommendation by the website)
The possibility is endlessâ€¦keep striving!
